QuizTime is a test of knowledge as well as a form of entertainment. It consists of a website with questions with multiple answers, only one of them is correct.
The user can only choose one answer from the four available. By clicking on the answers, the user finds out if it was right or wrong (green for correct and red for wrong) and counts one point per correct question. Then, clicking next and the process repeat till the end of questions. When the user completes all four questions, a score will appear showing how many answers they got right.

## [Testing](Testing)
- Testing was carried out both manually and automatically.

### Manual Tests:

    I check regularly to ensure that the results were as intended. I made use of developer tools within the browser constantly to check across a number of things. I would use the console tools to try out different ideas, particularly styling, to see how it worked in real time and then implement the code written there into the project itself. Responsiveness testing was done both through console tools, along with trying different browsers on different devices.

- I´ve performed the following checks:
-  Desktop and mobile:
    - Make sure content loads properly, and timely.
    - No erros in console log, or IDE.
    - Try differents users using differents methods as desktop, mobile and tablets.
    - Refresh the page when I was answering each questions so see the results.
    - All  tests were performed across multiple browsers and OS.

### Automated Tests:

 - I logged into my GitHub account and clicked the green button near the top left of the page displaying the text 'NEW'.
 - This took me to a page with the option to create a new repository. Under the repository template I clicked on the code institute template.
 - I chose a name for my repository and then clicked the create repository button.
 - I opened the new repository and clicked the green gitpod button to create a new workspace in Git Pod for writing and editing my code to develop the website.

### GitHub pages
