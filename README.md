    5. [Github](https://github.com/gleidecn/quiz-time)

    6. [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces)
    - This was my IDE for the project.

6. [Testing](#testing)
- Testing was carried out both manually and automatically.

- Manual Testing
    - While building the site I had a preview open in my browser that I would check regularly to ensure that the results were as intended. I made use of developer tools within the browser constantly to check across a number of things. I would use the console tools to try out different ideas, particularly styling, to see how it worked in real time and then implement the code written there into the project itself. Responsiveness testing was done both through console tools, along with trying different browsers on different devices.

- Automatic Testing
    - Performance and accessiblilty:
[Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)

    - Bugs
    - Known Issues
6. [Deployment](#deployment)
- I deployed this site through GitHub pages. This was a simple process, as follows:
    - Log into GitHub
    - Go to the repository (you must own it, so fork mine if deploying this site)
    - Go to settings
    - Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" section
    - Select the source (I chose master branch in this instance)
    - After some time, the site will be deployed at: http://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>

- Making A Local Clone
    - Log in to GitHub and locate the[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gleidecn/quiz-time)
    - Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
    - To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
    - Open Git Bash
    - Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
    - Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
    - Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
